    "\n",
    "Github's API is moving (slowly) over to GraphQL in place of their REST API. Given my prior exploratory analysis of Github's data [found here](https://github.com/EldritchJS/kono-notebook/blob/master/kono.ipynb) I set out to see what moving to the new API buys me, or loses me, as it were. Here's a few things that stand out:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Single Endpoint  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Query-driven syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The single endpoint trades looking up endpoint formats and return values for looking up query field and connector values. IMHO the latter is more advantageous, as endpoint syntax and formatting can get unruly in a hurry. Having a single endpoint lets data scientists focus on their queries, staying relegated to JSON. The queries follow (mostly) intuitive graph pattern wherein one traverses the docs/graphs until reaching the desired node(s).\n",

    "In terms of connections, to get started, one need only generate a personal access token on Github's site. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programmitically, one needs the requests and json Python libraries imported, per the following. Additionally, the single endpoint is defined along with my Github authorization token (which is a whole bunch of Xs for what's in the repo, go get your own token please)"
